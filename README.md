## Introduction:

This will be my first real project where it looks professional and I do everything on my own. I hope that this will help my fluency with making projects. I'd like to establish a workflow and get better at knowing where and how to start.

## Analysis:

Finally done! Took me a while and I struggled with getting alignments right, but after googling a bunch of stuff, it all worked out. I made it a beat website where people can buy my beats and maybe I'll use it in the future. I think I'd rather recreate it once I learn more things, though. It feels like it took way more time than it should so I hope I get a lot faster in the future. 

This project helped me to see things in terms of little containers. It also helped me figure out how my workflow should be, for the most part. I think it will change as I do more projects, but right now, I think I've established a good beginner's workflow.
